# Installation

Requirements:

- [Python 3.8+](https://docs.python.org/3/).
- [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/) (2022.3.5+).
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
- [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/).
- [CReM](https://github.com/DrrDom/crem) (0.2.9+).
- [Meeko](https://pypi.org/project/meeko/).
- [AutoDock-Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu/).

## Via pip (standard)

## Getting the last "stable" version

Strongly recommended; although this project is still in beta state.

```bash
    pip install moldrug
```

## Getting the development version

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/ale94mleon/moldrug.git@main
```

## Via conda

moldrug is also available through conda. However, the pip installation is the recommended one.

```bash
conda create -n moldrug -c ale94mleon -c conda-forge moldrug
```

```{note}
MacOS users may face some problems trying to install because of the AutoDock-Vina dependency. If that is the case, just download the executable as it is explained next.
```

If some dependencies are missing, please install them through pip. Some of them might be:

```bash
pip install meeko crem pyyaml scipy tqdm
```

## AutoDock-Vina dependency and related software

[AutoDock-Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu/) is the only non-pip dependency required for `moldrug`. [AutoDock-Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu/) is only relevant when the built-in cost functions of moldrug from {py:mod}`moldrug.fitness` are used. [AutoDock-Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu/) is an ongoing project, and it is advisable to stay up-to-date by regularly checking for the latest [release](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina/releases/).

As of the creation of this documentation, the most recent version is [v1.2.5](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina/releases/tag/v1.2.5). We will be using this version as a demonstration, but we strongly recommend using the most recent release for optimal performance and features. For detailed information, please visit the
[AutoDock-Vina installation instruction](https://autodock-vina.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Converting pdb to pdbqt for the receptor

This step can be achieved through [OpenBabel](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel) or [ADFR](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/downloads/). We recommend ADFR. Depending on the platform, you should be able to access the program `prepare_receptor` in different ways. In my case, it lies on `/Users/$USER/ADFRsuite-1.0/bin/prepare_receptor`. Then you can convert your ``pdb`` with:

```bash
/Users/$USER/ADFRsuite-1.0/bin/prepare_receptor -r your_protein.pdb -o your_protein.pdbqt
```

Check [here](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/how-to-create-a-pdbqt-for-my-receptor/) for more information.

## Getting docking box information

To perform docking you must provide `boxcenter` (`center` for AutoDock-Vina) and `boxsize` (`size` for AutoDock-Vina) to the cost functions defined in {py:mod}`moldrug.fitness`. For that, two PyMOl plugins are useful: [GetBox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ale94mleon/GetBox-PyMOL-Plugin/refs/heads/master/GetBox.py) and/or [autodock](https://github.com/ADplugin/ADplugin/blob/master/autodock.py). Details of their installation and use are not discussed here, please visit their corresponding repositories for more information.

## Working with a docker container

- Use the [Docker configuration file on GitHub](https://github.com/ale94mleon/moldrug/blob/main/Dockerfile).
- Visit the [moldrug's Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/ale94mleon/4moldrug).

Finally, `pip install moldrug` inside the container.
