# Note on CReM database

```{warning}
For the tutorials, we will use the CReM database `replacements02_sc2.db.gz`. This is just because is a smaller one and therefore it has a fast download. For real problems consider reading first the [CReM paper](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00431-w) and also see the discussion on [moldrug repo](https://github.com/ale94mleon/moldrug/discussions/6)
