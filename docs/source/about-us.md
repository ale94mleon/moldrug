## Project Origins

This project began during my Ph.D. studies at [Jochen Hub's Computational Biophysics Group](https://biophys.uni-saarland.de/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). It was carried out within the framework of the ITN (International Training Network) [PROTON](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/860592) and in collaboration with the pharmaceutical company [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/de/). If you are interested in getting in touch or learning more about my work, please visit my [Portfolio](https://alejandro.netlify.app).
