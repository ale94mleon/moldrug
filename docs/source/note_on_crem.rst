Note on CReM database
======================

.. warning::

    For the tutorials, we will use the CReM database ``replacements02_sc2.db.gz``.
    This is just because is a smaller one and therefore it has a fast download.
    For real problems consider reading first the `CReM paper <https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00431-w>`__
    and also see the discussion on `MolDrug repo <https://github.com/ale94mleon/MolDrug/discussions/6>`__
